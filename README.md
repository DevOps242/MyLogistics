# MyLogistics - Kotlin Mobile Application

-- The goal of this project was to create a mobile app that customers of MyLogistics can leverage to view their imported parcels to be delivered.

-- Parcels status would be managed by a Node web application that will act as the backend for this mobile app or the store manager.

## Features
-- In this mobile application, a user can register sign in, and add their home addresses.
-- Users can view their parcels and parcel details.
-- Users can view their international shipping address if forgotten.

## Challenges with this project
-- Challenge: Project scope was the huge for short time.
> Soltuion for this was to shorten some of the features like the ability to create delivery dates for a parcel to their home addresses. Also the ability to upload invoices for their packages.

-- Challenge: for this was after remove those features i had less options for the user to create object to be added to the database. 

-- Challenge: Building the navigation and allowing the focus to change
